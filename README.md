# IAB 2.0.2
(Bot for social web using Python and selenium)

Welcome.

This is version 2.0.2 of my development bot for social networks, this is the only version to date that I will launch publicly, its way of working is quite simple.

Each text document contains a parameter that the python code will interpret with selenium to work. They work as follows:

Users: Here should go the name of your user or account, for example "Redwolf2"

Pass: here should go the password

Usuarios: In this document is the list of users that you want the bot to follow and send messages automatically. It is working by line break, each line is a user

Followed: This list is not filled, here the bot will register everyone that it follows so as not to repeat them in a new code execution

Messages: here you place the messages that the bot will choose at random to work, the line break is also implemented here.
